## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to help a vacation app stregthen it's features for travel customers. In doing so, we create both travel desitnation and travel itinerary maps by employing Google API's with OpenWeatherMap. As a result of code scripts and doing API calls, we are able to apply weather descriptions and data to travel desitinations and ultimately help customers make vacation choices.


## Overview

In creating both the destination and itinerary maps, we started by generating 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes. And then with said coordinates, we picked a cities near us using citypy. Thereafter, we did an API call on OpenWeatherMap to apply weather data and descriptions for each city on our list. The final map products now include city, country, hotel name, weather description and current temperature.
